# Linux

A repo for either scripts or resources for my Linux Distro (currently Pop!\_OS)

### In the Scripts

- Flatpak Packages
- External Packages (from the source website)
- Icons Setup

### To Do (only if possible with terminal):
- Enable Gnome extensions
  - Setup extensions that I want
- Move Dock to the left & change opacity
- Install OhMyZSH with PowerLevel10k
